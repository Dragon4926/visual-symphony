webui.py: Streamlit Web User Interface for the Visual Narrative Generator.

This script creates an interactive web application that allows users to:
1. Upload an image.
2. View an AI-generated caption for the image.
3. Generate a short story based on the image caption.
4. Listen to an audio narration of the generated story.

It utilizes functions from `app.py` for the core generation tasks
(image captioning, story generation, and text-to-speech) and uses
Streamlit for building the user interface components and managing
the application flow.

    Constructs and runs the Streamlit web application for the Visual Narrative Generator.

    This function defines the entire UI layout and manages the interactive workflow:
    - Sets the main page title and a brief description.
    - Creates a sidebar for API key configuration and advanced settings (story length, creativity).
    - Divides the main page into two columns:
        - Column 1: Handles image upload and displays the generated caption.
        - Column 2: Handles story generation from the caption and TTS conversion,
                    allowing users to listen to and download the audio.
    - Utilizes `image2text`, `gen_story`, and `gen_tts` from `app.py` to perform
      the core AI-powered generation tasks.
    - Implements error handling to display issues gracefully within the UI.
